# Laravel-Simple-CRUD

## Summary
A simple CRUD application created using the Laravel framework. The app allows for user registration and sign in. Once signed in users can create posts, edit posts and delete posts.
The aim of this project was to teach me the basics of Laravel and help me get to grips with the MVC. As such, design was not relevant so I have only included some basic bootstrap styling.
